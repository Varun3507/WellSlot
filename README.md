# WellSlot ‚Äî Doctor Appointment Web App

This repository contains a MERN-style doctor appointment application split into three main parts:

- `backend/` ‚Äî Node.js + Express REST API, MongoDB models, controllers, auth middleware, Cloudinary and Razorpay integrations.
- `frontend/` ‚Äî Main public React app (Vite) used by patients.
- `admin/` ‚Äî Admin panel React app (Vite) used to manage doctors and appointments.

This README documents how to run, build, and deploy the project, lists required environment variables, explains authentication headers, and provides quick troubleshooting notes.

## Project layout

Root structure (important folders):

```
WellSlot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin/          # Admin React app (vite)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/        # Express API server (Node.js)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/       # Public React app (vite)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       # This file
```

Backend highlights:

- Entry: `backend/server.js`
- DB config: `backend/config/mongodb.js` (connects to `${MONGODB_URI}/WellSlot`)
- Cloudinary config: `backend/config/cloudinary.js`
- Routes: `backend/routes/*.js` (admin, doctor, user)
- Controllers: `backend/controllers/*.js`
- Models: `backend/models/*.js`

Frontend highlights:

- `frontend/` is the patient-facing React app (Vite)
- Vite config: `frontend/vite.config.js` (dev server port 5173)
- Entry: `frontend/index.html` -> `/src/main.jsx`

Admin highlights:

- `admin/` is the admin panel React app (Vite)
- Vite config: `admin/vite.config.js` (dev server port 5174)
- Entry: `admin/index.html` -> `/src/main.jsx`

## Quick start (development)

1. Install dependencies for each package (run in separate terminals or run each one sequentially):

```bash
# install backend
cd /WellSlot/backend
npm install

# install frontend
cd /WellSlot/frontend
npm install

# install admin
cd /WellSlot/admin
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` folder with required variables (see next section).

3. Start the backend and frontends (each in its own terminal):

```bash
# start backend (nodemon recommended for dev)
cd /WellSlot/backend
npm run server

# start patient frontend (Vite)
cd /WellSlot/frontend
npm run dev

# start admin frontend (Vite)
cd /WellSlot/admin
npm run dev
```

4. Open apps in the browser:

- Patient app: http://localhost:5173
- Admin panel: http://localhost:5174
- Backend API: http://localhost:4000 (default)

Note: `PORT` can be set in the backend `.env` to change the backend port.

## Environment variables (backend/.env)

Create `backend/.env` and include the following variables (example placeholders):

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster.mongodb.net
JWT_SECRET=super-long-jwt-secret
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminpassword
CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_key
CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY=your_cloudinary_secret
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_secret
CURRENCY=INR
PORT=4000
```


## Package scripts

Backend (`backend/package.json`):

- `npm run server` ‚Äî starts `nodemon server.js` (recommended for dev)
- `npm start` ‚Äî runs `node server.js`

Frontend (`frontend/package.json`):

- `npm run dev` ‚Äî start Vite dev server on port 5173
- `npm run build` ‚Äî build production `dist`
- `npm run preview` ‚Äî preview built site

Admin (`admin/package.json`):

- `npm run dev` ‚Äî start Vite dev server on port 5174
- `npm run build` ‚Äî build production `dist`

You can also install `concurrently` or similar tools at the repo root to start multiple services together. Example (optional):

```
# Example dev-start helper (not included in repo):
# concurrently "npm:server" "npm:frontend" "npm:admin" --names "BACKEND,FRONT,ADMIN"
```
---

If you'd like, I can create `backend/.env.example`, add a `dev` helper script at the root using `concurrently`, and create a short section in this README with explicit axios/baseURL examples for the frontends. Tell me which of these you'd like me to add and I'll implement them.
